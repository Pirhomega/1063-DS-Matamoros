ProgramName:	Program-3
Author:			Corbin Matamoros
Description:	
	This program will read in a bunch of animals names
from an input file into a doubly - linked list. It will then
prompt the user to input a random value, "m" between 1 and 13
(inclusive) and another random value between 1and RANDMAX. 
It will afterwards read in a value from the input file
again, find the length of that value, multiply it by "m" and
move that product's number of spaces within the linked list.
It will move to the right if the product is even and to the left
otherwise. The animal whose node the product landed on will be
deleted and the list will get smaller. Output will show only the
11th dispatched animal, however.
